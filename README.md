# AI Fake News Detector

## Project Overview
The AI Fake News Detector is a web application that analyzes news articles and predicts the likelihood of them being real or fake. This tool aims to combat misinformation by leveraging machine learning models trained on labeled datasets.

## Features
- **Text Analysis:** Users can input news articles or URLs for analysis.
- **AI Predictions:** The system uses a transformer model (e.g., BERT or RoBERTa) to classify news as "Real" or "Fake."
- **Confidence Score:** Provides a probability score indicating the certainty of the classification.
- **User Feedback:** Users can submit feedback on the AI's predictions.
- **History Tracking:** View past analyses for reference.

## Tech Stack
### Frontend:
- React.js (UI Framework)
- Tailwind CSS (Styling)

### Backend:
- Node.js with Express or Python with Flask/Django (API Development)
- MongoDB or PostgreSQL (Database)

### AI Model:
- Hugging Face Transformers (BERT, RoBERTa)
- PyTorch or TensorFlow
